# LS Testing Seminar App

4 versions of a Fullstack application for creating, reading and deleting "Cards" built with Svelte and Express. 3 of the versions each have a different bug most easily diagnosed with a particular type of test (unit, integration or e2e).

**Usage:**
- `cd` into each app version and run `npm i` to install its dependencies
- You may need to go the Cypress website and follow the installation instructions to get the e2e test working
